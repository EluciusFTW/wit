# What is the ...
A typical start of a question. This CLI answers some basic ones, right from your console.

## weather like in?

WIP connecting to the _openweatherapi_.

## current time in Amsterdam?
To find that out, type in 

```PS
wit time --in Amsterdam
```

This command uses the time zones provided by the [IANA time zone database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority#Time_zone_database). In case the parameter passed in for the location is not part of that set, the user will be prompted to select an area/city directly.
